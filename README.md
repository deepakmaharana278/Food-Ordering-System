# 🍽️ Food Ordering System

A full-stack **Food Ordering System** built using **React (Frontend)** and **Django REST Framework (Backend)**.  
This application enables users to browse food items, filter and sort products, manage cart and wishlist, place orders using cash or card payment, and submit reviews.  
A **custom admin dashboard** provides sales analytics, order management, and review moderation.

The backend exposes RESTful APIs consumed by the React frontend.
